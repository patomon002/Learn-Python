# print(5//2) - Using the // for division will give you a while number and ignore the float

# % - This will give you the reminder of the division.

# for example

# print(5 % 3) ---- This will result to 2, which is the reminder of the ZeroDivisionError

# print(int(11/5))  --- This will give us a whole number instead of decimals

# print(float(10/5)) ---- This will give us decimals instead of whole number
